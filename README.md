# Prime Group jQuery Challenge
jQuery is great! It allows us to do so many things! You and your group will need to flex everything you know about 
Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to tackle this challenge. 



## The Fruit Market
For this challenge, you will be working with 4 commodities; 
Apples, Oranges, Bananas, and Grapes. Delicious, right?



When the application loads, you will need to have information for each of the commodities, specifically the name 
and the ‘market price’ of each. This information will need to be displayed in a meaningful way on the DOM.



Every 15 seconds, the prices should change however, and with it, the listed price on the DOM. Specifically, 
the market price of each of the items should fluctuate up or down 50 cents with each 15 second interval. 
Any given fruit is not allowed to go below a cost of 50 cents, or above the cost of 9 dollars and 99 cents. 


The information displayed for each of the fruit should have a ‘button like’ functionality where the user can 
interact with each of the fruit displays.


Available to the user is a ‘total cash’ and an inventory display that shows how much of each of the fruits they 
have purchased. Also in the user display, should be an ‘average purchased price’, which shows, on average, how 
much money they have spent on a given fruit in their inventory.


Meaning that by clicking on the display for each of the fruits, allows the user to ‘buy’ one of the fruits, at 
market price, which will be deducted from the total cash. The user is not allowed to spend more than they have.


The user will start with $100.


Finally, style the whole experience with Bootstrap!


##Hard Mode
Create a button below each of the Fruit buttons that allows the User to ‘sell’ one of their fruits of the same 
type at the current market price. This will also remove one from their inventory. The user should be not able to 
sell fruits they do not already own.

##Pro Mode
Limit the application experience to five minutes. At the end, stop the price fluctuation, sell all of the fruits 
in their inventory at current market price, and then display the total money they earned from the experience.
